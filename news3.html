            <p>
                In this era, Artificial intelligence (AI) is has become so ubiquitous that human-AI interactions are becoming more frequent and complex,
                with a study from Japan finding that nearly 75% of participants have used AI for advice, where 39% view it as a stable presence. However, this kind of
                interaction has spanned beyond just for business purposes, where a growing number of users consider them friends, confidants, and even romantic partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the reason, the motives of forming emotional attachments to AI varies with individuals, but they generally include companionship, curiosity,
                therapy, and novelty. With the appearance of AI companions integrated into social media, millions of people now turn to AI chatbots to share
                emotional exchanges. A research found that widely available large language models (LLMs) can still be prompted to produce detailed information about
                self-harm and suicide despite built-in safety features, but framed in an academic manner. This has caused individuals suffering from emotional
                instability to confide in recently growing AI Chatbot Companions.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to Jamie Sundvall, a licensed clinical psychologist, clinical social worker, and assistant provost of artificial intelligence at Touro
                University, “patients have shared with me they seek out AI companionship to combat loneliness and to talk about special interests others may not be
                interested in, to detach from reality and avoid problems in their lives, to get emotional support and advice, and to work on social skills,” she noted.
            </p>
            <p>
                She also warned that Without human oversight and protective governance, these relationships may have benefits but could also be harmful, especially
                towards children and adolescents. These AI companions might suggest popular but harmful trends based on AI hallucinations that could could worsen anxiety
                and depression. Sundvall expects the market for AI tools that help people emotionally bond with chatbots to grow by 30% in the next few years, and said
                "we have to carefully balance the advancement of AI with concerns for ethical and safe use."
