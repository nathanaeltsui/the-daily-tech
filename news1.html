                OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation tool, Sora 2 was released on 9 September 2025, generating 5 million user downloads in just 5 days.
                Its popularity can be explained by a number of improvements from the previous model. OpenAI explained that the new model introduces improvements in
                various aspects compared to previous models, such as more accurate physics, sharper realism, synchronized audio, enhanced steerability
                and an expanded stylistic range. However, this has also resulted in an increasing number of deepfake videos found on social media, with many having
                public figures as the subject of likeness. Although mainly for entertainment purposes, it can be detrimental to the public image of real life
                individuals depending on how it is used.

                Social media platforms, such as YouTube and TikTok have recently been flooded by AI generated videos featuring deceased public figures. This does
                not violate OpenAI's guidelines as consent to feature only applies to living people, while an exception is given to likenesses of celebrities,
                sportspeople and politicians that are deceased, which they referred to as "historical figures". Some videos even contain these "historical figures"
                performing slanderous acts, tarnishing the legacies of the real individuals.

                This has sparked outrage from families of deceased celebrities featured in these videos, one being the daughter of late actor Robin Williams,
                Zelda Williams. She has urged fans to stop sending her AI-generated videos of her late father. “It's dumb, it's a waste of time and energy...not
                what he'd want”, she wrote on Instagram.

                OpenAI has warned users about the potential misuse of Sora 2. They wrote on their website, “Sora 2's advanced capabilities require consideration of
                new potential risks, including nonconsensual use of likeness or misleading generations.” They have also vowed to take action accordingly, “We're taking
                an iterative approach to safety, focusing on areas where context is especially important or where risks are still emerging and are not fully understood,”
                as noted on their website.
